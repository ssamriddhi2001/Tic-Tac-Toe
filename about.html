            Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic
            paper-and-pencil game that is easy to learn and can be played by
            people of all ages. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the
            objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, either
            horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is played by two players, who take turns placing their
            symbol (usually X or O) in one of the empty spaces on the grid. The
            first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins the game.
            If all spaces on the grid are filled and no one has three in a row,
            the game is a tie.
